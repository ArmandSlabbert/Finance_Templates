# 📘 Finance Operating Manual – Governance Framework

## Why This Manual Exists
The Finance Operating Manual is the central control framework for how
finance activities are executed, reviewed, and evidenced.

It converts accounting requirements into repeatable operational
processes that management and auditors can rely on.

## How To Use This Manual
Users should:

1. Identify the relevant process area  
2. Follow the applicable SOP  
3. Prepare evidence as required  
4. Obtain the defined review and approval  
5. Escalate exceptions where necessary  

If an activity is not documented or supported, it is considered incomplete.
