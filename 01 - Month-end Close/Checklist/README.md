# Month-End Close – Checklists

## Overview
This folder contains operational checklists used to execute and
evidence the month-end close process.

The checklists are designed to support consistency, accountability,
and audit readiness by tracking task completion, ownership, and review
throughout the close cycle.

## Purpose of Checklists
The checklists translate documented procedures into practical,
repeatable actions performed during each reporting period.

They are used to:

• Track progress against the close timetable  
• Assign responsibility for each activity  
• Evidence completion and review  
• Support internal and external audit requirements  

## Contents
• **Month_End_Close_Checklist.xlsx**  
  A detailed, step-by-step checklist covering key month-end close
  activities, including journals, reconciliations, reviews, and
  sign-off.

## How This Fits Into the Process
• The **SOP** defines *what* must be done and *why*  
• The **checklist** shows *how* and *when* tasks are completed  

Together, they form part of the organisation’s Finance Operating Manual.

## Usage
Checklists are updated during each close cycle and retained as
supporting documentation for management review and audit purposes.

## Disclaimer
These checklists use dummy data and are provided for portfolio and
educational purposes only.
