# Finance Operating Manual & Control Environment

## Overview
This repository presents a practical finance operating model built from
real-world Financial Accountant and Finance Manager responsibilities.

It demonstrates how finance moves from transaction capture through to

escalation.

The focus is on **repeatability, governance, and evidence**.
